### Libraries Explained.

**[4k]** These are the 4k files, you need a 4k TV and a fast internet connection to access these. (More in a Dedicated Section Below)

**[Remux]** This library contains the highest Quality 1080p possible. These are the same quality as the BluRay disks we buy.

The below libraries are dynamic and updated every night at midnight. Pulled from various sources like iMDB, and trakt.tv.
These were added to give suggestions and more of a Netflix Style not sure what to watch. Check out what others are watching.

## Discord Channel

A new but a great place to talk to others members myself. Request Content or Assitance. 
If you are not sure what discord is here is a link to the discord page.

Discord App [Discord](https://discordapp.com/).

Discord Channel [Crumb Flix](https://discord.gg/Ycjqxvv).


## Requests

You can go about this only two ways.

My prefered way is to use the website for this. For a few reasons. You will get an email when the item you asked for is actually added into the system. This also allows for rate limits so you don't request a TV show that has been on for 40 years and ask the system to go out and get all 40 years worth. Cause honestly that takes a while.

**Request Site [Ombi](https://kickthetree.com/).**

If you are going to use the above site. Your login is youur username and password with plex.tv and it is case sensitive on each field. 

*Discord Channel* While this works it is not my favorite one. For the reasons above. But if you wish to use it join the channel and follow the directions.


## Problem with a TV Show or Movie. IE the wrong ep. Wrong movie, Language etc.

Best method is to logon to the request site above. Here you can put in your issue which will alert me and I can correct it. 
If the issue is with a TV show please give me the Season and Episode number.
Also let me know the library you are playing out of Example 4k remux etc to make sure I correct the right one.

*Alternate Method*

You can also hit me up on the discord channl. Although not as effective but it will work.

#Organizr Page

Here you can login with your plex.tv account info. You can access the request site. The systems calendar system so you can see upcoming shows to be added. When they will be available etc. You can even see the real time que of what is currently being pulled into the system.
As well as what is being played at that time. You won't be able to see the who just the what.

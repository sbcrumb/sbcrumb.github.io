### Libraries Explained.

**[4k]** These are the 4k files, you need a 4k TV and a fast internet connection to access these. (More in a Dedicated Section Below)

**[Remux]** This library contains the highest Quality 1080p possible. These are the same quality as the BluRay disks we buy.

The below libraries are dynamic and updated every night at midnight. Pulled from various sources like iMDB, and trakt.tv.
These were added to give suggestions and more of a Netflix Style not sure what to watch. Check out what others are watching.

## Discord Channel

## Requests

You can go about this only two ways.

My prefered way is to use the website for this. For a few reasons. You will get an email when the item you asked for is actually added into the system. This also allows for rate limits so you don't request a TV show that has been on for 40 years and ask the system to go out and get all 40 years worth. Cause honestly that takes a while.

**Request Site [Ombi](https://kickthetree.com/).**

*Discord Channel* While this works it is not my favorite one. For the reasons above. But if you wish to use it join the channel and follow the directions.
